# SE3355_MidtermProject

The project contains HTML, CSS and Javascript files.

I created the api from the website you provided mocky.io.  The api contains 10 cities and 10 course types.

index.html file contains the backbone of the webpage.

submit.html is the page you get directed to when the information you fill in the form is correct.

dummy.html is an empty page.

styles.css contains the styling of the webpage. It has the code that makes website responsive.

app.js contains the e-mail and phone number validations.

api.js contains the http request from the api, accessing the cities and the courses from the api and adding them to the related options part.


Note: The information taken from API takes a little long to load so you may need to wait for some time.
